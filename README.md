## Assignment_1_Python_Fundamentals
This assignment contains solutions for Python Assignment 1, covering basic Python concepts such as variables, data types, arithmetic operations, input/output functions, and string formatting. The exercises help beginners practice fundamental programming skills through simple tasks like printing text, performing calculations, and handling user input.   
## Assignment_2_Data_structures_in_Python
This assignment covers fundamental data structures in Python, including lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples. The exercises provide hands-on practice with key operations such as adding, removing, and iterating over elements in each data structure. The list exercises focus on creating and updating lists, while the dictionary exercises involve adding key-value pairs. The set exercises demonstrate adding and removing elements, and the tuple exercises explore immutable sequences. 
## Assignment_3_Conditional_and_Looping_Statements
This assignment contains solutions to various Python exercises covering topics like conditionals, loops, and user input handling. The exercises include tasks such as printing the corresponding month from a number, calculating ticket prices based on age, calculating BMI, finding the greatest of three numbers, calculating factorials, reversing numbers, finding multiples, handling user input with loops, and printing patterns like FizzBuzz and number sequences. 
## Assignment_4_Python_Functions
This assignment covers fundamental concepts of Python functions, including built-in functions, user-defined functions, and variable scope. It demonstrates the use of the len() function to find the length of a list and includes implementations of greet(name), which prints a greeting message, and find_maximum(numbers), which finds the maximum value in a list without using max(). The project also explains the difference between local and global variables through an example where both exist with the same name. Additionally, the calculate_area(length, width=5) function is implemented to show how default arguments work by calculating the area of a rectangle when the width is either provided or not.
## Assignment_5_File_and_Exception_Handling
This assignment focuses on file operations and exception handling in Python. It includes various exercises demonstrating essential file handling techniques such as reading from a file, writing to a file, copying file contents, and counting words in a file. Additionally, it covers exception handling with try-except blocks to manage common errors like file not found, invalid user input, and division by zero. Users will also practice handling lists of integers, validating input, and computing averages with proper error management. These exercises enhance understanding of working with files and handling exceptions effectively in Python.
## Assignment_6_Part_Assignment_OOPs
This assignment includes two Python programs demonstrating object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. The first program manages a university course catalog using a base class Course and two subclasses, CoreCourse and ElectiveCourse, which extend the base class with additional attributes. The second program defines an Employee class inside a module named employee, with attributes name and salary along with getter methods. The program demonstrates importing and using the module to create and display employee details. These implementations showcase inheritance, encapsulation, and modular programming in Python.
